    <!--Explaining the triangle-->
    <!--
    We are now manually drawing the triangle fo the house.
    M15 50: M stands for move (where we want to start to draw) 15 = x-axis, 50 = y-axis
    L48 12: L stands for Line To (where we will draw a line to position) 48= x-axis, 12 = y-axis
    q2,-2 4,0: this is quite complex. This uses the quadratic bezier curve formula.
    2,-2 means where is the Control Point from the current position (which is 48,12)
    The Control Point true position is x=50, y=10.
    4,0 is the destinion point, which the true position is x=52, y=12 which is 4 pixels from the start position (which is 48) on the X-axis.
